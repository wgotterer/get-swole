Let's Get Swole!!!!!!!!!!!

# Get Swole
An application built with a React front end and Rails back end that allows a user to schedule one on one sessions witha trainer as well as use follow along videos to get swole. 

## Description

Using custom routes in Rails, a session cookie is created when a user logs in or signs up keeping the user logged in until the logout button is pressed and the session is deleted. A user has the ability to see past private classes and upcoming classes. One can also filter through a library of follow along videos based on name and category, leave reviews, and delete reviews. If user is logged in and is a designated trainer then that trainer can upload, edit, and delete online private classes as well as see all their current follow along classes in the "/trainer" section/path.
